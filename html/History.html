				<p>Olmecca civilization (from 1500 BC to 400 BC)
				The oldest trace of cacao comes to the Olmeca tribe who built the oldest civilization in Central America in a fertile lowland along the Gulf Coast. There is a word cocoa (cacau) in the Olmecca civilization, and it is said that the Olmeca people used cocoa first.<br>
				Maya civilization (around the 4th to 9th centuries)
				The Maya began cultivating cacao on Yucatan Peninsula. There are carved pots engraved with cacao in a ceramic pot before the year 500 AD excavated from the Mayan civilization. There are also vases in which cacao residue is detected from the inside.
				The Maya used cacao as money and played an important role as a dedication to God in ceremonies. It is speculated that in the upper class wedding cacao beverages were playing like modern champagne.<br>

				Tolteca (10th - 12th centuries)
				The Tolteca flourished in the 10th - 12th century after the Maya tumbled, and conveyed advanced civilization to the next Aztec tribe. The Tolteca group was divided into smaller countries and repeatedly fought over land and contribution delivery, but it is said that the dispute over cacauao production area was particularly great.</p>
